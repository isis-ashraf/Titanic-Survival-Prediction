# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze and predict passenger survival on the Titanic using the famous Titanic dataset. The goal is to explore relationships between features and train classification models to predict survival chances.

## Dataset
The dataset is based on the historical Titanic passenger records, containing information such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, number of siblings/spouses aboard, and survival status.

## Objectives
The project covers the following key tasks:

### Data Exploration and Cleaning
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns in the dataset.
- Handle missing values appropriately.
- Convert categorical features into numerical values for model compatibility.

### Data Visualization
- Visualize survival distribution across different features such as class, gender, and age.
- Use bar charts, histograms, and box plots to derive insights.

### Machine Learning Models
- Implement and compare multiple classification models:
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  - **Na√Øve Bayes**
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- Tune hyperparameters and evaluate models based on accuracy and other performance metrics.

## Results
- Comparative analysis of classification models for survival prediction.
- Insights into key factors influencing passenger survival which are none in titanic case but this project shows usage and implementation of different analysis and machine learning models.
